## About me
I am starting front-end developer who worked as an accountant for 8 years before, but I realized that I want to develop in a different area.
I like to do useful things and constantly develop, to learn new things, and I also like to solve interesting tasks.

## Skills

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- Redux
- Git, Github

## Code example
**Task**: Odd or Even? <br>
**Solution**: <br>
        ```
        function oddOrEven(array) {
        //enter code here
        let result = 0;
        for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i ++) {
            result = result + array[i];
            console.log(result)
        }
        
        if (result % 2 === 0) {
            return 'even'
        } else {
            return 'odd'
        }
        }

        let arr = [7, 10, 5, 40];
        console.log(oddOrEven(arr));
        ```
